# Design and Prototyping

## Submission Point Three

SP3 is an assessed feedback session with tutors. Use the planning document as a guide. Marks are awarded for engagement and preparedness.

The following documents should be presented. Note that they are not being finally assessed. This is a chance to get formative feedback on your progress.

- [Mood boards](#mood-boards)
- [Style Guide](#style-guide)
- [Page Design](#page-design)

## Mood boards

To kick off the design process, each team member should create a mood board to collate influences and ideas for their design. The influences may be digital or physical and might include elements such as colour and typography.

> &ldquo;Mood boards are visually stunning collections of ideas, full of textures and images that communicate the vision of a designer at the start of a project.&rdquo;

Read the article [20 pro tips for creating inspirational mood boards](https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/mood-boards-812470) before starting.

You can create your mood board any way that suits: photoshop, powerpoint, pinterest or even a physical item.

Once you have shared your ideas and inspirations through your individual mood board, create a team mood board that reflects the ideas and inspirations you want to take forward into your designs.

For this submission output your mood boards as per the personas report. Add to the following file:

> Document: [mood-boards.md](mood-boards.md).

_Your mood boards will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP3. They are marked at SP5._

## Style Guide

> &ldquo;We all know that feeling: some time after we launch a site, new designers and developers come in and make adjustments. They add styles that don’t fit with the content, use typefaces that make us cringe, or chuck in bloated code. But if we didn’t leave behind any documentation, we can’t really blame them for messing up our hard work.
>
> To counter this problem, graphic designers are often commissioned to produce style guides as part of a re-branding project. A style guide provides details such as how much white space should surround a logo, which typefaces and colours a brand uses, along with when and where it is appropriate to use them.&rdquo; [Anna Debenham](https://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/).

Create a style guide for the Guide using the template provided. Use colour, typography and media that best represents the brand of your guide (based on your moodboards).

To better understand [style guides see some examples at styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/).

**Note** - It is likely that both the colour and typography will change over the life of the project. Ensure that the style guide is kept up to date to reflect the final design of the guide presented for SP5.

_Your style guide will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP3. It is marked at SP5._

## Page design

### What is this?

This technique involves creating a final page design after each team member has tried creating an initial design for your group’s web site. Each person works independently, and when finished, shares his/her concepts with the team. The team then considers each solution, and each member uses the best ideas to further improve their own solution.

> &ldquo;This process helps to generate many different, diverse ideas and ensures that the best ideas from each design are integrated into the final site design. What is most striking about parallel design is how many ideas can be considered in a very short time period.&rdquo; [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/parallel-design.html)

### To start the process

- Each team member must work independently on his/her own design concept for your website.

- Your design may address issues such as layout, space, form, colour, typography whilst always considering usability and accessibility.

- Consider your design from a ‘mobile first’ perspective.

- All of your design concepts should be created initially as low-fi wireframes on paper. **Pencil &amp; paper first!**

> Get your ideas down on paper, iterate and refine later.

- Your design concept can be further developed as hi-fi or low-fi using the various techniques explained in class.

- These techniques include a composition (comp) created in Photoshop, a low-fi HTML/CSS wireframe (perhaps using a grid system) or a mock-up using [Axure](https://www.axure.com/edu), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html), [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup), [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com), [Figma](https://www.figma.com) or [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

> You can use [dummy text and images](https://contentsnare.com/dummy-text-image-generators/) as placeholders.

**Tip:** _Be creative, but keep it realistic. After all, you’ve got to build this at some point. It also has to be both accessible and useable_.

### Parallel design process

1. Once everyone has completed their initial designs the team should get together and share their design concepts and other ideas.

> Following this meeting each member should review his/her own design to make amendments and improvements.

2. The team should then meet for a final time to agree which elements from the individual designs will be used to create the team's _final design_.

> Note - these meetings can be virtual. For example you could post images of your work on GitHub and discuss on the project Kanban board.

3. The last task for the team is to create a _final design_ (mobile and desktop). This is the design you intend to take forward into the build process, and which will be tested in SP4.

<!-- ### Try this on your final design

**The 5-second test:** Show a number of people the _final design_ for 5 seconds (or for another short period of time). This approach is best for accurately capturing people’s ‘gut reaction.’ 5 seconds of viewing time is too short for reading copy or for noticing details like specific fonts or colors, but it is enough for forming an impression which accurately reflects the visual style.

Record their comments, discuss as a group - do they love your design? Have they spotted something that needs changing? -->

### Page Design Report

Each group member will add their design plus the group's _final design_ to the file:
