# Portfolio

For Submission Point 5 all of the following documents (i.e. anything with a link) need to be completed and in place to be assessed.

## Documents presented for SP1 · Week 3

- [Ideation report](1_User_and_Competitor_Research/ideation.md)
- [Initial User Research report](1_User_and_Competitor_Research/user-research.md)
- [Client proposal](1_User_and_Competitor_Research/proposal.md)
- [Competitor analysis](1_User_and_Competitor_Research/competitor-analysis.docx)

### Advice on how to complete these documents

**Synchronous** means everyone working together in real-time, e.g. in your Teams breakout room. In some cases you don’t need to see each other, so try using a google shared document to write in real time?

**Asynchronous**: for these tasks, try using Friday sessions to give people (some of?) the work to complete in their own time - making sure they know what’s required - and the group reviews it later. Be careful with the software you use to create work: think about how you might need to share this work to get feedback on it or collaborate with others to refine it.

**Always** find a way of having someone else check your work for quality (of writing, of thought) - in the end you are all relying on each other for your final mark.
